    /*Purpose of program
    Get user input and use that to select an object to execute for the user
    We are going to make up objects* for the user

    1. Get a keyword from the user
    2. use the keyword as a enum value
    3. use the enum in a switch block
    4. use the switch block to link to object or
     */
    /*
    What do we need to accomplish this?
    1. we need a class to get the keyword from the user: class GetDataClass
    method: getData()
    parameters: none
    return: String value...we wish this were an enum value...is possible?

    2. we need to return that keyword as an enum
    method: make the key to the switch block
    parameters: the String from the getData()
    actions: change the String to an enum somehow
    make the enum object for the switch block
    return the enum object...maybe

    3. we need to use that enum keyword in a switch block
    method: switch block which takes an enum keyword
    the selects a case to execute

    4. need other classes which will be selected by the switch statement

    5. an IFclass to compare to the switch statement
